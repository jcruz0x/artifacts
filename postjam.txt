-- cut these improvements (not worth it):
* add a few more small maps
	- side areas
	- extra dungeon layers? (3 in each?)
	- go inside buildings?
* refactor code:
	- redesign a lot of stuff to make more sense
	- base enemy class that otheres inherit from?	
* better pizazz:
	- sparkles when dashing
	- straight line when dashing = dash attack?
	    (after going in straight line, speed up like mario)
	- screen shake?
	- do dash like zelda? (with invincibility)
	- shield artifact now attacks

	
* fix existing maps
