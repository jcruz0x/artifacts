# Artifacts Of Monstrosity

A game I made for Ludum Dare 33, created originally in 72 hours for the Jam. 
It did use some code from a previous project (as allowed by the rules) and
I did some post-jame work on improving it, adding sound, etc. It still could
use a lot more polish but for a game jam game I'm damn proud of it.

Written in javascript and using html5 (canvas, etc.) directly, no frameworks
or library code. Designed so that you can download and play it by double clicking
the play.html file, you don't need to setup a server or anything.

You can play the original jam version online at
[the original ludum dare page](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-33/?action=preview&uid=30829)
